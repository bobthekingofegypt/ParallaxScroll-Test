ParallaxScroll
==============
This is just a little project I was using when playing with how to do parallax scrolling of a background image behind a recyclerview.

It works by redrawing different sections of the background image based on the current scroll position of the recyclerview.

It's not a library, just some sample code of how this functionality could work.  It requires the recyclerview to have fixed size items and a constant item decoration.
